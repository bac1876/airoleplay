# COMMUNICATING FOR REAL


### REVIEW - PACE

What is a PACE?
It is something that is true for your client
- You make a statement and they agree
- Agreement can be verbal
- Non-Verbal – shake their head
- Just in their head
Example
Client: We are moving to Florida

### 2 TYPES OF PACES

1.Universal Pace
1. Today is Thursday
2. We are meeting on Zoom
2.Personal Pace (Subjective)
1. I like large back yards
2. I’m going to buy a house before June 30th
3. I want to be a successful real estate agent
4. We are having a child therefore we need a bigger home
5.You are really excited to get into your new home

### EXAMPLE PACE


Buyer
- You want to move by the end of the month

- You have 3 kids each needs their own bedroom
- You want to be in subdivision “X”
- Your max price is $650,000

### EXAMPLE PACE


Seller
- I want to move by the end of June
- I want an agent that communicates well
- I want net $100,000
- I want an agent that does open houses

### LEAD

What is a LEAD?
- What I want them to see
- What I want them to think
- What I want them to accept

### EXAMPLE LEAD

### LEAD

5. And school district “X” is a deal breaker for you? (PACE)
Great so next step is for us to go look at some homes – sound good?

### 5 YES TECHNIQUE

With all that in mind that next step is to meet with the lender
and then go look at some homes (YES)
does that sound good?
does that make sense?
does that work for you?
“Great we can meet with the lender tomorrow evening or on
Saturday which works better for you?

### CAUSE AND EFFECT

- 100% Responsibility
- Are you at CAUSE or EFFECT
- People at cause are empowered people at effect are
disempowered
- What would happen if you were at cause for everything in
your life
- At a minimum BE AT CAUSE for your reaction

### CAUSE AND EFFECT

Definition: Implying that one thing causes another
- Note the word implying
- Important to identify when your client is talking
- Important to use tactically when you are communicating

### CAUSE AND EFFECT (LISTEN)

- Listen for cause and effect statements from your clients
- You can help them get “unstuck”
- I’m going to terminate because the seller is being such a jerk
- Is the seller being a jerk
- Is the seller just stressed out like you
- Is there something we don’t know about the seller
- Is it possible there is a miscommunication

### CAUSE AND EFFECT (LISTEN)

- “How Specifically is the seller being a “jerk”
- How specifically – Chunk Down
- I appreciate that the seller seems like jerk, let me ask this is it
possible that the seller and the other agent just didn’t
communicate very well and are you willing to lose this house
just because it?
- Is there another possibility

### CAUSE AND EFFECT (LISTEN)

- I appreciate how frustrating it can be when a seller is not
being very cooperative – sometimes it could be because
their a jerk in my experience most of the time it’s because
they don’t have the resources or some other thing we don’t
know– does that make sense?
- Redefine the behavior
- I can really appreciate that seller is not cooperating with us
BUT my question is how do you feel about the house?
- FLIP the but
- Change the focus

### CAUSE AND EFFECT (LISTEN)

- I can really appreciate that you want to work with the listing
agent to save money on the commission. BUT what if working
with the listing agent will actually cost you money? Let me
explain on the average I negotiate more than 3% for my
clients by negotiating price, closing costs and repairs. If you
work with the listing agent they have a duty to remain neutral
in the transaction and cannot negotiate on your behalf and
over 90% of the homes in our market are still offering a
commission so is it really worth it to be unrepresented?
- Change the focus
### • BUT


### THINGS YOU SAY

Examples
Looking at the comps makes you see the value of your home
more clearly – doesn’t it
You having so many questions that means we should…SET AN
APPOINTMENT… to ensure you will get all of your answers,
don’t you agree?

### THINGS YOU SAY

Examples
Pricing your home competitively means we will get more
showings and get your home sold quicker, that’s want you want
isn’t it?
Talking to a lender before we look at more homes empowers
you to write strong offers, don’t you agree?

### THINGS YOU SAY

Examples
Working with a team that does aggressive marketing on your
homes means you will get more people in the door don’t you
agree?
Learning these techniques demonstrates your commitment to
your success doesn’t it?
Writing strong offers motivates the seller to work with us
wouldn’t you think?

### THINGS YOU SAY

Examples
Fixing the major things on the repair list shows the buyer you
are being reasonable – make sense?
The original price we list at often determines the success of the
sale – do you get that?
Writing an appraisal gap proves to the seller you are a serious
buyer – doesen’t it?

### CONDITIONAL BIND

- Conditional binds are language patterns used to create a
connection between an action and a desired outcome.
- They are a form of embedded command where one action is
linked to another
- The goal is to influence behavior by implying that a certain
condition will lead to a specific result.
- Conditional binds work because if the pace is accepted, then
the lead will be accepted.

### WORDS THAT BIND


Mus t
Need Will s ee
Have to Want to Would
S hould

### CONDITIONAL BIND

Step 1 – come up with a pace that is personal
Step 2 – come up with a lead you want
Simple IDEA – Since the PACE is true then “obviously” LEAD
If PACE then LEAD

### CONDITIONAL BIND

If it is important then you must do this
Example
You said selling your home quickly was important (YES)
- then you must price it according to the market
- then obviously you need to have a strong agent
- then naturally you will see the value in all of the marketing
we do to get people to come and see your home

### CONDITIONAL BIND (QUESTION)


Process
Step 1 – Ask a Question (one that we know the answer to)
Step 2 – Their answer becomes the PACE
Step 3 – Have a LEAD in mind
Step 4 – If ANSWER then LEAD
The best PACE is their ANSWER!

### CONDITIONAL BIND (QUESTION) THAT’S EXACTLY WHY

Example
Q - What price would you like to list your home for?
### A - $350,000

Perfect that’s exactly why we need to get it staged and on the
market while it’s still a strong seller’s market
Example 2
Q – When do you want to be in your new home
A – Before July 1st
Perfect that’s exactly why we need to…START LOOKING
NOW…what works better for you looking during the day or nights
and weekends?

### CONDITIONAL BIND (QUESTION) BECAUSE OF THAT

Example
Q – When do you want to have your home on the market
A – Next Week
Absolutely and because of that we need to…START TODAY…,
let me go over the contract
Example 2
Q – How much money do you want to make this year?
### A – $50,000

Perfect because of that you need to commit to a plan for lead
generation!

### CONDITIONAL BIND

Step 1 – come up with a pace that is personal
Step 2 – come up with a lead you want
Simple IDEA – Since the PACE is true then “obviously” the LEAD
must also be true (IF THEN LOGIC)
If PACE then LEAD

### CONDITIONAL BIND

If it is important then you must do this
Example
You said selling your home quickly was important (YES)
- then you must price it according to the market
- then obviously you need to have a strong agent
- then naturally you will see the value in all of the marketing
we do to get people to come and see your home

### CONDITIONAL BIND

Example 2
If you want to buy a house in this market (YES)
- then you must write a strong offer with no contingencies
- then obviously we will have to use an appraisal gap
- then naturally you write the strongest offer you can

### CONDITIONAL BIND PLUS TIE-DOWN

Example
If you want buy a house in this market (YES)
- then you must get aggressive with your offers, does that
make sense?
- then obviously you need to have a pre-qual so the seller will
know you are a serious buyer, don’t you agree?
- then naturally you will pick experienced agent to make sure
you get what you want, right?

### CONDITIONAL BIND PLUS EMBEDDED COMMAND

Example
If you want to sell your home quickly (YES)
- then you must…PRICE IT AGGRESSIVELY…don’t you agree?
- then obviously you need to… HIRE A STRONG
AGENT…does that makes sense?
- then naturally you would…HIRE THE NUMNER 1
TEAM…wouldn’t you?

### Q&A


### OBJECTION HANDLING

## PART 1


### RAPPORT

- Vital before you objection
- How can you be persuasive if person does not know,
like and trust you?
- How do we build Rapport?

### OBJECTION HANDLING

- What is this about?
- Understanding People and helping them get to their goals
- Building framework to help you handle situations

- What this is not about
- Scripts to help you get what you want
- Tricks to make people do what you want them to do

“You will get all you want in life, if you help enough
other people get what they want.” – Zig Ziglar

### OBJECTION HANDLING - PHILOSOPHY

- Consider this to be a puzzle or an equation
- You can’t finish it or solve for it because there are
pieces missing
- Lack of patience shows lack of confidence
- Patience shows high Emotional Intellegence
- Dance with the client

### WHAT IS AN OBJECTION?

- It is a reason or argument that goes counter to our goal
- An expression or feeling of disapproval or opposition
- A reason to not do what we want people to do

- An objection is a question that we have not
answered YET

### WHAT IS A CONDITION

- A genuine reason not to buy or sell
- Valid reason to make a different choice
- Something that we cannot do anything about
- Example 1: The house is worth $450,000 and the seller wants $500,000
and they need that money to pay off debt or they can’t buy their next
home
- Example 2: I can’t buy a house until after my divorce is final
- Example 3: They have a 400 credit score, no job, and $100 in the bank

### CONDITION VS OBJECTION

“I have a credit score of 450 and I have not had a job in 2 years”

“I believe a more experienced agent would do a better job
selling my home”
“I don’t want to work with just one agent to help me buy a
home”
“I don’t want to look at homes until June when my spouse gets
here”

### PSYCHOLOGY OF OBJECTIONS

- Click – Run Response
- People have been trained for years to say these things that are not
actually objections
- These are automated responses
- They generally mean nothing
- “I’m just looking”
- “I just wanted to know if it had a big back yard”
- I was just wondering if the seller would take less money for the
home
- Look for the “JUST”

### PSYCHOLOGY OF OBJECTIONS

- Fight or Flight Kicks in
- People are telling you the one thing you don’t want to hear
- There is a rejection “script” that runs in your brain when this happens
- You get in your emotions instead of staying logical
- This is happening for most of us even if we are not aware of it

- Countering the Fight and Flight
- Patience is the key
- Staying on guard
- Having a standard process to deal with this is essential

### ARP

- We can use this simple technique when people go into click-run Automation
- This is a simple technique that allows us to move forward with a conversation
and avoid getting stuck in “RED HERRINGS”
- Red Herrings – statements made to throw us off our game
- Statements often viewed as objections – but they are really not
- Just want to know what your commission is before I set the appointment
- Just wondering what you think my house should list for
- Just wondering…..

- This all has to be done without PAUSE

### ARP

-A – Acknowledge
- Repeat back the client what they said
- Keep it simple and conversational
- C - “Just wondering if the seller would take less than ask pricing”
- A - “Got it you want to know if you can get the house for less than
asking”

### ARP

-R – Respond
- Simply answer the question
- People are much more savvy today you can’t get away with talking
around it
- C - “Just wondering what you charge for listing a home”
- R – “Our team generally charges 6% we do have some special programs
that we charge less and I would be happy to talk about those when we
meet”

### ARP

-P – Pivot
- Talk about what we want to talk about
- Do this without pause
- Gets the conversation moving in a direction where we can succeed
- C - “Our team generally charges 6% we do have some special programs
that we charge less”
- A – “With that in mind why don’t we set a time for us to meet I can show
you are marketing and you can decide what plan works best for you – I
have time on Thursday or over the weekend what works best for you?”

### ARP

- Example
- C - “Just wondering if the seller would take less than ask pricing”
- A - Perfect so you were wondering if the seller would take less than
asking price
- R – Honestly I don’t know what they will take for the home they never
tell me that
- P – With that in mind why don’t we go look at the house and see if it
fits your needs and if it does we can decide how to move forward
from there – I have time today after 5 or we could meet tomorrow
morning which works best for you?

### ARP

- Example
- C - “Just wondering what you charge for listing a home”
- A - Perfect so you were wondering what we charge for listing a home
- R – Generally we charge 6% but it really depends on the situation
- P – With that in mind why don’t we meet and I’ll show you what we do
to earn that commission and you can decide if that makes sense for
you – I have time on Wednesday or Thursday which works better for
you?

### THIS IS YOUR NEW RESPONSE

- I want you to focus on an Objection means they still want to work with
you
- An objection is an UNANSERWED QUESTION therefore – if we answer
the question we create a win-win
- I want you to focus on this as a GOOD THING
- “I’m so excited that you brought that up – many of my clients have had
the same question”
- “I’m happy that you thought of that – so many people miss that”

your emotional intelligence

- Ask Questions and Isolate
- Handle the Objection
- Close

### ACKNOWLEDGE AND AFFIRM

- Show people you are listening and you value them
- It puts you in alignment with the other person
- It eliminates the feeling of “I’m right you are wrong”

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TERMS

### PERFECT

### THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE

### ABSOLUTELY

### GREAT

### FANTASTIC

### YOU’RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

### THAT’S VALID

### THAT’S A VALID CONCERN

### YOU’RE RIGHT

### I CAN APPRECIATE THAT

### I UNDERSTAND


### AMAZING

### MOST PEOPLE TELL ME THAT

### WOW THAT’S AWESOME

### I CAN SEE THE BENEFIT IN THAT

### TERRIFIC

### THAT’S RIGHT

### THAT’S TRUE

### I AGREE

### WONDERFUL

### I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN


### EXAMPLE

- I just want to work with the listing agent
- Acknowledge and Affirm – I’m so excited that you brought that up I
speak with a lot of people who want to work with the listing agent
- We are going to work with the agent who helped us buy this house
- Acknowledge and Affirm – Perfect a lot of people work with the same
agent that helped them buy the house
- Notice there is NO argument it is an agreement FRAME!
### • DO NOT USE I UNDERSTAND!!! – WILL BREAK RAPPORT


### THE PROCESS -STEP 2 – QUESTIONS - ISOLATE


- Makes sure we are having the correct conversation
- All too often people are closing the wrong objection or
worse creating a new one
- When you ask enough questions you can get clarity
and help the client feel heard!

### THE PROCESS -STEP 2 – QUESTIONS - ISOLATE


- Why does someone want to only work with the listing agent
- Had a bad experience with a buyer agent who didn’t know
anything about the house
- Had an important person tell them this is the best way
- Thought they could get a deal by working with the listing
agent

### THE PROCESS -STEP 2 – QUESTIONS ISOLATE

- Isolating will also often bring out other objections we need to handle
- So beside the commission is there any other reason you wouldn’t want to list your
home today – “Well we really feel like the price should be $450,000 and you
suggested we list it at $410,00”
- Start over with the new objection
- “Perfect that makes a lot of sense to me that you would want to get the most money out of your
home. Out of curiosity if we were to list your home at $450,000 would that make you feel
comfortable”

### THE PROCESS -STEP 2 – QUESTIONS ISOLATE

- Other than that is there any reason you would not want me to be your
agent
- Is there anything else besides the commission that would keep you
from hiring me to sell your home
- Besides the price of the home is there any other reason you don’t
want to write an offer today

### THE PROCESS -STEP 2 – QUESTIONS ISOLATE

- What specifically makes you believe that X is in your best interest?
- What is the benefit to you of X
- Beside X is there any other reason you wouldn’t Y

### THE PROCESS – STEP 3 HANDLE THE OBJECTION

- Fancy way of saying – ANSWER THEIR QUESTION!
- Really what we are doing is offering them a different perspective
- Have you looked at it from this direction
- We are allowing them to see it in a new light

### FEEL FELT FOUND


- Trying to let people know you get it
- You can use yourself or a third party
- Simple Technique – still very effective

### FEEL FELT FOUND

- Objection - Only want to work with the listing agent
- Acknowledge and Affirm - I appreciate that you want only
want to work with the listing agent I hear that from a lot of
people
- Question/Isolate - Out of curiosity what is the benefit of
working with the listing agent for you?
- Buyer Answer - I think I can get a better deal
- Isolate - Besides that is there any other reason you wouldn’t
want to work with me? - NO

### FEEL FELT FOUND

- Perfect let me say I know exactly how you feel, I like to get
a great deal just as much as the next person, and many of
my clients have felt the exact same way, but what they
found was that working with the listing agent was actually a
disadvantage to them because they missed out on some of
the buyer programs we have that can save a lot of money
and actually help them get the best deal on buying a house
– You wouldn’t want to miss out on that would you? Great –
so let me show you what that looks like and see which
makes more sense for you – sound good?

### FEEL FELT FOUND

- Objection – Waiting for interest rates to drop again
- Acknowledge and Affirm – Amazing I believe a lot of people are going to wait for interest rates to go down
- Isolate – Besides waiting for the interest rates to drop is there any other reason you don’t want to own a home
today
- Buyer Answer – No we would love to own a home
Perfect let me say I know exactly how you feel, and many of my clients over the last few months felt the exact same
way as they watched interest rates continue to rise and add some challenge to the homebuying process, however
here is what most of them found after they did they research, they found that owning right now actually provided
them with significantly more security because they now have a fixed payment they are comfortable with and they
don’t have to worry about their landlord raising rent which is rampant right now and on top of that they can see
that when interest rates go down they can do a refinance and get their payment even lower – does that make
sense?
Great so why do we just go look at a few homes and see if we can find something that fits your budget and lifestyle
and if it does then great if not you can always rent – I have time on both Saturday and Sunday which day works best
for you?

### HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN

- This Techniques Leverages Past Mistakes
- We are inventing Generic Mistakes
- Draw a parallel between new mistake and old mistake
- Remember that people don’t like to make mistakes
- Remember people really don’t like to make the same mistake
twice
- Finally remember people HATE it when other people know
they are making a mistake

### HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN

- I’m excited that you brought that up AND
- I can appreciate that you want to wait until the market becomes
more affordable
- Let me ask you this…has there ever been a time when you were
thinking about taking some action and you waited and later you
regretted it?

### HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN

Objection – The Market is going to crash we want to wait until that
happens
Response
Approve and Affirm: Great I can appreciate that a lot of people are very
cautions about this current real estate market
Isolate the objection: Besides your concern over the market crashing is
there any other reason you don’t want to buy a home now?
Buyer Response: No we just think waiting for the market to crash is safer
then buying now

### HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN

Let me ask you a question has there ever been a time when you were wanting to buy
something and you waited and waited and then you really regretted it because the
opportunity was gone? My concern is that is exactly what is going to happen to so
many people in this market. Here are a couple of things we know the demand is
lower and supply is higher then it was at the beginning of the year but all the
experts are saying even though the economy may not be strong housing is going to
continue to inflate just like everything else, as a matter of fact they are expecting
that over the next 5 years the housing market will increase over 20%. To put that in
perspective a house that you could buy today for $500,000 will cost over $600,000
by then. Here is something else to consider if interest rates drop back down many
people believe we will be pushed right back into the crazy market of multiple offers
and people way overpaying for homes and the only people who will truly benefit
from the rates dropping are people who already own a home – does that make
sense?

### HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN

Objection – I want to wait until interest rates come down into the 4s or
lower
Response
Approve and Affirm: Great I can appreciate that a lot of people are very
cautions about buying at the current rate
Isolate the objection: Besides your concern over the interest rates are
their any other reasons you wouldn’t want to own now
Buyer Response: No we just don’t want to pay too high of an interest rate

### HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN

Let me ask you a question has there ever been a time when you were wanting to buy
something and you waited and waited and then you really regretted it because the
opportunity was gone? My concern is the current real estate market is just like that. Lots of
people were waiting for rates to go down and inventory started to go up, but what’s
happened over the past few months is people are seeing that if they don’t…BUY NOW…
they are going to get priced out of the market for a long time and all the experts are saying
that the market is continuing to increase and they don’t see interest rates coming down
below 6% for at least 24 months and by then the market will have increased significantly
and the only people who are truly going to benefit are those who already own homes
because they will simply be able to refi and have significant equity. For example if you buy
a $500,000 house today the experts are expecting that house to be worth about $550,000 in
two years so if you can afford to…BUY NOW… you can get the benefits of appreciation and
be able to refi – I don’t know about you but where else can I make $50,000 in 2 years with
less than a $500/month investment – so it up to you does it make more sense to keep renting
or to invest TODAY? (Lessor of 2 evils)

### Q&A


### MILITARY PATTERN

1. Repeat and Affirm
2. Isolate the objection
3. What would happen if you did it a different way
4. Because here is why that different way is a good idea
5. If you would be willing to do that I would be willing to do this for you
6. Close

### MILITARY PATTERN


- Objection: We want to wait until interest rates drop
- Repeat and Affirm: Excellent I’m glad you thought of
that and I can appreciate that you want to wait until
interest rates are a little lower
- Isolate: Besides the interest rate is there any reason
why you would not want to buy now?

### MILITARY PATTERN

- So what would happen if waiting for interest rates to go back down wasn’t
the best idea? What do you mean?
- Let me explain - if interest rates go back down we are going to go right back
where we were at the beginning of the year where all the homes were
selling in multiple offer situations and buyer were having to come up with
thousands and thousands of dollars in cash to pay the difference between
the purchase price and the appraised value (you could put a 3rd party story
here) – you don’t want that do you?
- Perfect so if you would be willing to look at some homes and see if there are
any that fit both your needs and your budget I have made a special deal with
my lender to offer no cost refi’s when the interest rates go back down and
you won’t have to deal with all the craziness like we did last year and you
can potentially get the best of both worlds– sounds good doesn’t it?

### WHAT IS AN OBJECTION?

- An expression or feeling of disapproval or opposition
- A reason to not do what we want people to do

- An objection is a question that we have not answered YET

### 4 STEPS FOR HANDLING AN OBJECTION

- Acknowledge and Affirm
- Ask Questions and Isolate
- Handle the Objection
- Close

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TERMS

### PERFECT

### THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE

### ABSOLUTELY

### GREAT

### FANTASTIC

### YOU’RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

### THAT’S VALID

### THAT’S A VALID CONCERN

### YOU’RE RIGHT

### I CAN APPRECIATE THAT

### I UNDERSTAND


### AMAZING

### MOST PEOPLE TELL ME THAT

### WOW THAT’S AWESOME

### I CAN SEE THE BENEFIT IN THAT

### TERRIFIC

### THAT’S RIGHT

### THAT’S TRUE

### I AGREE

### WONDERFUL

### I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN


### EXAMPLE

- I just want to work with the listing agent
- Acknowledge and Affirm – I’m so excited that you brought that up I
speak with a lot of people who want to work with the listing agent
- We are going to work with the agent who helped us buy this house
- Acknowledge and Affirm – Perfect a lot of people work with the same
agent that helped them buy the house
- Notice there is NO argument it is an agreement FRAME!
### • DO NOT USE I UNDERSTAND!!! – WILL BREAK RAPPORT


### THE PROCESS -STEP 2 – ISOLATE THE OBJECTION


- Makes sure we are having the correct conversation
- All too often people are closing the wrong objection or worse
creating a new one
- Examples
- Besides X is there any other reason you would not want to Y
- Out of curiosity what is the benefit of X

### THE PROCESS – STEP 3 HANDLE THE OBJECTION

- Fancy way of saying – ANSWER THEIR QUESTION!
- Really what we are doing is offering them a different perspective
- Have you looked at it from this direction
- We are allowing them to see it in a new light

### FEEL FELT FOUND


- Trying to let people know you get it
- You can use yourself or a third party
- Simple Technique – still very effective

### FEEL FELT FOUND

- Objection - Only want to work with the listing agent
- Acknowledge and Affirm - I appreciate that you want only want to work with the listing
agent
- Isolate - Out of curiosity what is the benefit of working with the listing agent for you?
- Buyer Answer - I think I can get a better deal
- Isolate - Besides that is there any other reason you wouldn’t want to work with me? - NO
- Perfect let me say I know exactly how you FEEL I like to get a great deal just as much as the
next person, and many of my clients have FELT the exact same way, but what they FOUND
was that working with the listing agent was actually a disadvantage to them because they
missed out on some of the buyer programs we have that can save a lot of money and
actually help them get the best deal on buying a house – You wouldn’t want to miss out on
that would you? Great – so let me show you what that looks like and see which makes more
sense for you – sound good?

Current Value of a home - $500,000
Year 1 increase - 3.78% - $500,000 x 1.0378 = $518,900
Year 2 Increase – 3.36% - $518,900 x 1.0336 = $536,335
Year 3 Increase – 3.87% - $536,335 x 1.0387 = $557,091
Year 4 Increase – 4.18% - $557,091 x 1.0418 = $580,377
Year 5 Increase – 4.11% - $580,377 x 1.0411 = $604,231
Total Equity = $104,231

### LEVEL SHIFT

Objection – The Market is going to crash we want to wait until that
happens
Response
Approve and Affirm: That’s great I’m hearing a lot of people are very
cautions about this current real estate market
Isolate the objection: Besides your concern over the market crashing is
there any other reason you don’t want to buy a home now?
Buyer Response: No we just think waiting for the market to crash is safer
then buying now

### LEVEL SHIFT

Level Shift: It sounds to me like … (Shift Phrase) what is important to you
is making good financial decisions is that correct? Perfect and I believe
that is a very smart thing to do. Here is what all of the experts are saying
– the market is not depreciating it is simply appreciating at a slower
pace, the experts are saying that due to high demand and low supply
that the market is actually going to appreciate over 15% in the next 5
years. That means a house you buy today $500,000 today will be worth
approximately $600,000. What it really comes down to is can you find
and afford the home you want to buy or you can rent – so which do you
feel is the best financial decision for you– buying a home now or
renting?

### EXAMPLE

Objection: We are not wanting to pay a buyer commission
Response:
- Approve and Repeat: I understand a lot of people are looking at a new way of doing real estate
- Question/Isolate – what is the benefit of not offering a buyer commission?
- We save money
- Perfect you will definitely have less costs by not paying a buyer commission
- Level Shift: However, what I think I am hearing is, (Shift Phrase) that you want to do is net more
money when you sell your home correct? Perfect most of my clients are trying to get the most out
of there home and what we have seen in markets where this new policy has been in place for a
while is the people who do not offer a buyer incentive are actually making less money on the sale
of their home because about 80% of buyers can’t come out of pocket to pay the commission and so
they won’t even look at homes that are not offering the buyer incentive – does that makes sense?

### EXAMPLE

Objection: We don’t want to sign a buyer agency agreement
Response:
- Approve and Repeat: I understand a lot of people are concerned about the new way we are doing real
estate
- Question/Isolate – what is the benefit of not hiring an agent
- We want to save money
- Perfect you will definitely could potentially save some money
- Level Shift: However, what I think I am hearing is, (Shift Phrase) that you are concerned that you will have
to pay me out of your pocket correct? Here is the good news all the sellers are having the same
conversations with their agents, here is the conclusion they are coming to in the new process of selling
real estate over 90% of buyers surveyed said they don’t want to pay their agent out of their pocket so the
majority of sellers are offering commissions or paying them through seller concessions either way my
clients are not paying out of pocket, so you can either go and sign a new agreement with every listing
agent because this is required by law or you can work with me and if we can’t get the seller to pay the
commission I will release you from our contract, so either way you won’t have to pay me out of pocket,
which makes more sense to you?

### HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN

- This Techniques Leverages Past Mistakes
- We are inventing Generic Mistakes
- Draw a parallel between new mistake and old mistake
- Remember that people don’t like to make mistakes
- Remember people really don’t like to make the same mistake
twice
- Finally remember people HATE it when other people know
they are making a mistake

### HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN

Objection – We are waiting for rates to come down
Approve and Affirm: Great I a lot of people are waiting for rates to
comer down
Isolate the objection: Besides your concern over interest rates is there
any other reason you don’t want to buy a home now?
Buyer Response: No we just think waiting for rates to drop is safer then
buying now

### HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME WHEN

Let me ask you a question has there ever been a time when you were wanting to buy
something and you waited and waited and then you really regretted it because the
opportunity was gone? My concern is that is exactly what is going to happen to so
many people in this market. Here are a couple of things we know demand is going
up as many people have begun to accept that rates are not going down anytime
soon supply is also pretty low. With that in mind housing like every other industry in
the US right now is continuing to inflate just like everything else, as a matter of fact
they are expecting that over the next 5 years the housing market will increase over
15%. To put that in perspective a house that you could buy today for $500,000 will
cost over $600,000 by then. Here is something else to consider if interest rates do
drop back down many people believe we will be pushed right back into the crazy
market of multiple offers and people way overpaying for homes and the only people
who will truly benefit from the rates dropping are people who already own a home –
does that make sense?

### MILITARY PATTERN

- Modeled after military recruiters
- Arguably the hardest sale in the world
- Do you want to sign up to stop bullets for a living?

### MILITARY PATTERN

1. Repeat and Affirm
2. Isolate the objection
3. What would happen if you did it a different way
4. Because here is why that different way is a good idea
5. If you would be willing to do that I would be willing to
do this for you
6. Close

### MILITARY PATTERN


- Objection: We want to wait until interest rates drop
- Repeat and Affirm: Excellent I’m glad you thought of
that and I can appreciate that you want to wait until
interest rates are a little lower
- Isolate: Besides the interest rate is there any reason
why you would not want to buy now?

### MILITARY PATTERN

- So what would happen if waiting for interest rates to go back down wasn’t
the best idea? Client - What do you mean?
- Let me explain - if interest rates go back down we are going to go right back
to where we were a few years ago where all the homes were selling in
multiple offer situations and buyer were having to come up with thousands
and thousands of dollars in cash to pay the difference between the purchase
price and the appraised value (you could put a 3rd party story here) – you
don’t want that do you?
- Perfect so if you would be willing to look at some homes and see if there are
any that fit both your needs and your budget I have made a special deal with
my lender to offer no cost refi’s when the interest rates go back down and
you won’t have to deal with all the craziness like we did a few years and you
can potentially get the best of both worlds– sounds good doesn’t it?

### MILITARY PATTERN

- What would happen if - So what would happen if waiting for interest rates to go
back down wasn’t the best idea? Client - What do you mean?
- Because here is why a different approach is good - Let me explain - if interest rates
go back down we are going to go right back to where we were a few years ago
where all the homes were selling in multiple offer situations and buyers were
having to come up with thousands and thousands of dollars in cash to pay the
difference between the purchase price and the appraised value (you could put a
3rd party story here) – you don’t want that do you?
- If you would be willing to - Perfect so if you would be willing to look at some
homes and see if there are any that fit both your needs and your budget Then I
would be willing to - I have made a special deal with my lender to offer no cost
refi’s when the interest rates go back down and you won’t have to deal with all the
craziness like we did a few years and you can potentially get the best of both
worlds– sounds good doesn’t it?

### MILITARY PATTERN


- Objection: We don’t want to pay a buyer commisison
- Repeat and Affirm: Excellent I’m glad you brought that
up and I can appreciate that you don’t want to pay a
buyer commission
- Isolate: Besides that is there anything any other reason
you would not want to move forward?
### • NO


### MILITARY PATTERN

- So what would happen if not offering a buyer incentive wasn’t the best
idea? Client - What do you mean?
- Let me explain – About 80% of buyers cannot afford to pay their
commission out of pocket and as I’m sure you know the law of supply
and demand applies to housing just like every other industry and if
you immediately eliminate 80% of your buyers it is going to be very
challenging to sell your home – can you see that? (Trial close)
- So if you would be willing to offer a buyer’s incentive to look at your
home I would be willing to reduce my commission by one percent for
any buyer that does not have an agent should create a great win-win –
sounds good doesn’t it?

### MILITARY PATTERN


- Objection: We don’t need a buyer agent
- Repeat and Affirm: Excellent I’m glad you brought that
up and I have heard from a lot of people they don’t
want a buyer’s agent
- Isolate: Besides that is there anything any other reason
you would not want to work with me?
### • NO


### MILITARY PATTERN (FINISH OR DELETE)

- So what would happen if working with just the listing agent isn’t the best
idea?
- Client - What do you mean?
- Let me explain – There are going to be very few agents who are going to be
willing to work with people who are unrepresented because basically they
are going to have to do the work on both the buyer’s agent and the listing
agent which means they have less time and energy to work on their
livelihood and you are more than likely going to get inferior service – does
that make sense? (Trial close)
- So if you would be willing to commit to me I would be willing to check on
every listing before we look at it and then we can see the impact the
commission has on your buying power and you can decide which listings
will work best for you– sounds good doesn’t it?

### STEP 4 CLOSE

3. Take 100% Responsibility

### STEP 1 – RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM

- Recognition is where it all begins
- Shift from Negative to Positive
- Focus on EVERYTHING we say
- Is there a better way to say it?

### BUT - AND

### • BUT = DIMINISH

### • AND = ADDS TO

### • I REALLY LOVE YOU BUT

### • I REALLY LOVE YOU AND

### • I THINK THIS IS A GREAT HOUSE FOR YOU BUT

### • I THINK THIS WOULD BE A GREAT HOUSE FOR YOU AND


### THESE WORDS ARE USALLY INTERCHANGEABLE


### FLIP THE BUT

- Finish on the positive!
- This house fits ever one of your needs BUT it has a few issues that you
are going to have to deal with
- Where is my focus?
- The house has a few issue that you are going to have to deal with BUT it
fits ever one of your needs

### REFRAMING

- Saying something from a different point of view
- When clients are doing a “mind read”
- Mind Read = educated guess of what someone is thinking
- “The seller is being stubborn I’m going to back out”
- “The seller wants too much for the property”
- “The buyer is being unreasonable with their repair requests”

### REFRAMING

- Personal Reframes
- The market is too challenging right now
- Good thing there will soon be a lot less competition from other
agents
- Good thing we have the best team in the state and therefore we will
get even more market share

- We decided to wait until July
- Great at least I have a deal on the books for July now

### REFRAMING

- “The seller is being stubborn I’m going to back out”
- The seller may be stubborn and may be acting like a jerk or maybe
they just need the money to buy their next house – so let me ask you do
you still love this house and it is worth starting the process over
because of $2000
- “The seller is crazy and wants too much for the property”
- Maybe they are a little overpriced but just because they listed it at
$500,000 does not mean they will not take less
- “The buyer is being unreasonable with their repair requests”
- Sure they are asking for a lot but maybe they don’t have a ton of money to
make repairs so maybe we just reach out and find out what is essential to
them and see if we can hold the deal together – make sense?

### REFRAMING

- Challenge your teammates to reframe
- Challenge yourself to reframe everything (positive way)
- Have fun and practice
- Remember we can’t be in people’s heads

### BEING RIGHT

- Give up on being right
- I can be RIGHT or I can be_______________________________
- Connected
- Rich
- Happy
- Fulfilled

### CONFIRMATION

### BIAS


### HOMEWORK

### RATE OF SPEECH GAME

1. Do it with everyone you meet
2. Get them to come with you
3. Restart Again
The more we make people feel comfortable the more they are likely to open up and share!
The reason people are not opening up is because they don’t feel safe enough!

### •Q & A


### VALUES


### REVIEW


- Rapport
- Embedded Commands
- Tie Downs

### REFRAMING


- What is reframing?
- Content
- Context

### CONTEXT REFRAMING


Reframe:
Think of a different context in which the person will
respond differently to the same behavior.

### CONTEXT REFRAMING

- Complex Equivalence
- Refers to 2 things being equals
- Look for words like “MEANS”
- Bob doesn’t want to work with me that means he is a jerk
- Sue didn’t answer my call that means she is blowing me off
and I lost a client
- The other agent was irritated and they won’t do a good job
presenting my offer

### CONTEXT REFRAMING

- Comparative Deletions
- Comparison to someone or something that is not specified
- It is better to do things the way we have always done them
- It is always best to submit an offer lower than asking price
- It is best to ask for all repairs from an inspection
- Notice the implied “They say”
- “Who says”

### MEANING REFRAME

Reframe: Ask yourself,
- What else could this behavior mean?
- Internally think of an opposite frame or a different meaning?
- What is it that this person hasn’t noticed that will bring about a
different meaning, and change his response?

### MEANING REFRAME

- Cause and Effect
- This causes that
- When I meet a new client I am nervous
- Client causes nervous
- What if “nervous” was just excited because they feel the
same in your body.
- I’m confused at all this new information
- New info causes confusion
- The fact your confused means you are learning lots of
things that are easy used to confuse you

### MEANING REFRAME

- The result of the lawsuit means I’m going to work harder and
make less money
- The lawsuit is going to ensure only the best agents like me
are successful
- I’m excited that my competition will decrease significantly
- I’m excited that I won’t have to work with crappy agents
anymore

### PRE-FRAME

- Similar to a reframe
- A reframe is about changing someone content or context based on their
feedback
- Example: I believe it is not a good time to buy a home because I think the market is
going to crash
- I appreciate and a lot of my clients have told me the same thing. Could I offer you a
different perspective? – The last the time the market crashed it was do to 100%
financing and many loans that adjusted to very high interest rates, along with people
having limited to no equity in their homes. Today most owners have equity in their
homes by both having to make significant downpayments and the increase in the
market over the last 36 months as well as less than 1% of buyer have used a variable
rate mortgage in the past 10 years. Could you see how different those 2 markets are.

### PRE-FRAME

- With a pre-frame we are making the presumption that the other
person will have an objection or a concern about what we are about
to present so we “Pre-Frame” or handle the objection before it comes
up
- Use pre-frames sparingly because you could create an objection
where one does not exist.
- Example: I want to talk to you before we get started about why the real estate
market is not likely to crash in the next few years
- Maybe they had not even considered this idea and now we have created
problem where one did not exist.

### WHAT ARE VALUES

- What’s important to US
- Single word or Phrase that has complex meaning for us
- What motivates us in advance
- Was it a good use of my time was it worth it
- If your number one value is not being met you will bail
- People leave for their values

### WHAT ARE VALUES

- What if someone’s number one value in working with
an agent is organization and you don’t know that?
- You show up 1 min late they judge you
- You show up not completely organized they judge you
- You show up with out an exact plan they judge you

### YOU JUST GOT FIRED!


### WHAT ARE VALUES

- What if you knew exactly what the client wanted?
- First you can show up how they need
- Second you might decide they are not the client for you
- But most importantly you have the information to make
the BEST decision for you!

### LOGIC VS EMOTION

- Logic makes people think
- No one makes decisions for logic
- We use logic to justify our decisions
- When we get people to “THINK” that’s exactly what they do

- Emotions drive actions
- Everything we do we do for emotional reasons
- Everything we buy we buy for emotional reasons

### ERA

- Emotional Reason to Act
- This is the key to helping people get what they want
- If we find THIS then we can base all of our actions on this understand

- What was found in research
- If people were asked why do you want X
- What the reason you want Y
- They would not answer authentically – they would tell you what they
thought you wanted to hear

### PRE-FRAME

- Before we move forward I want to spend a few minutes making sure that we are getting all of your
needs met in a few areas. So if you are ok with it I’m going to ask you some questions and I going
to dig a little bit deeper than most agents do, let me explain why. First of all buying a home is one
of the 5 most stressful things people do the others are marriage-divorce, the death of a loved one,
major illness and job loss with that in mind I want to make sure before we get into the process I
understand at a deep level what you wants in needs are in 2 specific area.
- The first I want to know what you are looking for in a home, and I want to focus on the most
important things. We know that 99% of the time people do not get everything they want in a
home even if they have it built specifically for them, but we want to ensure that at a minimum you
get the things that are most important to you, does that make sense?
- Great the second thing I want to discuss is what’s important to you in reference to me, each
person I work with has different ideas and expectations for an agent and I want to make sure I at
least meet and hopefully exceeds your expectations does that sound good?

### WHY PEOPLE WORK WITH US

People work with people they:
- Know
- Like
- Trust

The process of getting in alignment with others values is
critical to establishing this

### VALUE ELICITATION

- Finding the emotional driver
- The key question we have to ask is?
- What’s important to you about____________

### FINDING THE CORE

- What is important to you about____________
- Is the first answer really the answer we are looking for?
- Some people will get a little uncomfortable
- Most people you have to go a little deeper with
- We want to ask the question over and over until the person gets
“stuck”

### FINDING THE CORE

Continued
- Then we will take a break talk about something else and then come back
- Do this at least 2 times ideally 3
- In some cases (non-emotional) you need to ask another question

- Perfect if you don’t mind so I can understand better WHAT SPECIFICALLY is
important about that?
- Example: Hardwood floors are important – Great so what specifically is important
to you about hardwood floors? We are allergic to dust and carpet holds a lot of dust
– perfect do you have any other concerns about allergies?
- We just like the look – great so are you ok with high end laminate or engineered
hardwoods or are you looking for sand and stain hardwoods?

### WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT

- You are getting to REALLY understand their needs
- They will feel heard and taken care of
- You will start to see patterns in people’s responses
- You are getting to their real EMOTIONAL reasons to take
action
- We are following a strategy and science

### RACK AND STACK


- Once we have all the values we rack and stack them
- Which one of these is most important to you
- Then next and next until you have them all ordered
- At most the top 5 are the ones that matter – this is
where we want to focus
- Re-write the list and have them agree to it

### BUTTON IT UP

- You now have all their values in the list
- They have agreed to them
- You can now ask this:
- Ultimately if we are able to get you most of these items in a home
you will be happy and excited to move forward, won’t you?
- Ultimately if I am able to meet your values when it comes to a real
estate agent then you will be happy to have me as your agent?
Wouldn’t you?

- This is how we LEAD. The best agents LEAD their clients!

### LAST QUESTION


- Fortunately, I believe we can accomplish exactly
what you are wanting so all we have to do is:
- Sign the contract
- Start looking at homes
- Get you pre-qualified
Doesn’t that sound great?

Values
- Let go of right and wrong
- Know the Motivators
- Observe without Judgement
- Adapt your communication

### WHAT ARE YOU CREATING


### ASSUMPTION

- Assume the sale – What does it mean?
- Assumption is essential in the sales process
- It provides a level of confidence
- It moves people along without appearing high
pressure

### PRESUPPOSITIONS

- Specific type of assumption
- They allow you to subtly convey suggestions to the
subconscious mind without critical analysis and help
create new and better Internal Representations (I/Rs)
for people.
- Dennis Waitley proved in the 1980s that the
subconscious mind doesn’t know the difference
between something imagined fully versus something
that happens in reality.

### PRESUPPOSITIONS

- Most powerful way to “assume” the sale or “assume”
an outcome
- Presuppositions also tend to displace resistance to
your influence
- In general, if you want someone to think a thought or
do an action, get them to see/hear/feel it in their
mind (Repetition is essential)

### ADVERB PRESUPPOSITION

- Verb – an action word
- Adverb is a word that modifies a verb it describes the
action

### 5 YES TECHNIQUE

“Perfect with all that in mind we should get together as soon
as possible and get started on your search
does that sound good?
does that make sense?
does that work for you?
“Great so I have time on Thursday and Friday which of those
days works best for you?” (slot close)

### 5 YES – EXAMPLE

We want to make an offer on this home we would like to write an offer for $500,000 (House listed
for $500,000)
“Great so you want to write an offer for $500,000 let’s talk about that and put together a plan to
make sure you get this home”
1st let me say I will write an offer you want but let’s consider a couple of things before we come up
with an offer.
1. We are in an extremely hot seller market as you have seen by all the homes selling so quickly
2. This house has been on the market for 1 day
3. The listing agent told us they have one offer already and they are expecting several others
4. Most homes in this neighborhood have sold above asking price
5. You mentioned that you are ready to stop looking and get to get into your new home
With all that in mind I believe we should write a much stronger offer and do everything we can to
get you this homes (lead) – are you ready to everything we can to get this house? (Close)

### PRESUPPOSITIONS

- Specific type of assumption
- They allow you to subtly convey suggestions to the
subconscious mind without critical analysis and help
create new and better Internal Representations (I/Rs)
for people.
- Dennis Waitley proved in the 1980s that the
subconscious mind doesn’t know the difference
between something imagined fully versus something
that happens in reality.

### PRESUPPOSITIONS

- Most powerful way to “assume” the sale or “assume”
an outcome
- Presuppositions also tend to displace resistance to
your influence
- In general, if you want someone to think a thought or
do an action, get them to see/hear/feel it in their
mind (Repetition is essential)

### CONDITIONAL BIND (QUESTION) THAT’S EXACTLY WHY

Example
Q - What price would you like to list your home for?
### A - $350,000

Perfect that’s exactly why we need to get it staged and on the
market while it’s still a strong seller’s market
Example 2
Q – When do you want to be in your new home
A – Before July 1st
Perfect that’s exactly why we need to…START LOOKING
NOW…what works better for you looking during the day or nights
and weekends?

### CONDITIONAL BIND (QUESTION) BECAUSE OF THAT

Example
Q – When do you want to have your home on the market
A – Next Week
Absolutely and because of that we need to…START TODAY…,
let me go over the contract
Example 2
Q – How much money do you want to make this year?

gone over a lot of information (pace), and you let me know what
your expectations are for selling your home (pace), and you want to
list the home for $400,000(pace), so our next step is to schedule the
photographer so we can get professional pictures (lead), make
sense? (tie-down)
Since you want your home on the market next week (pace), it would
be best to get the photographer here this week so we have plenty of
time (lead), and then all I need you to do to get us going is to sign
above your name (lead), sound good?

Looking at the comps makes you see the value of your home more
clearly – doesn’t it
Since you have so many questions that means we should…SET AN
APPOINTMENT… to ensure you will get all of your answers, don’t you
agree?
Not offering a BUYER INCENTIVE means less people will come and
look at your home – does that make sense?
The fact that 3 other homes sold in your neighborhood and we have
only had one showing proves we are overpriced for this market, can
you see that?

### SINGLE BINDS

a lot to learn

### SINGLE BINDS

a sellers market

### SINGLE BINDS

Process
The faster you pace the happier you lead
I believe if we can close quickly it will make the seller
happy
The faster we can make the closing the happier the seller
will be

### DO IT TWICE (BINDS THAT BIND BINDS)


Write a strong offer
The more you study the market the better you will
understand what a seller is looking for
And better you understand the seller the better offer you
can write
Does that make sense?

### DO IT TWICE (BINDS THAT BIND BINDS)

We have to get in a house quickly

The stronger you make your offer the more likely the
seller is to accept it.
And since they are more likely to accept it will be much
easier to get you in your new home quickly.
Doesn’t that sound great?

### DO IT TWICE (BINDS THAT BIND BINDS)

Sell a house quickly
The more you study the comps the easier it will be to see the
market value for your home and the better you price your home
the quicker it will sell.
Sounds like a good plan – right?

### DO IT TWICE (BINDS THAT BIND BINDS)

The quicker you …SIGN THE CONTRACT…the sooner you will
see the results of our marketing and the sooner you will get a
great offer for your home
Make sense?
The more you study the market the more you will realize it’s and
extreme sellers market and the more flexible you are with the
seller the more likely you are to get the house (delayed
occupancy, waiving contingencies, ect)

### DO IT TWICE (BINDS THAT BIND BINDS)


Offering a Commission
The easier you make it for buyers to buy your home the
faster it will sell and the faster it sells the less stress you
will have getting to moved across the country. (notice
pace)
That’s what you want isn’t it?
Great so let me show you why all of my clients are offering
buyer incentives – sound good?

### EITHER OR (DOUBLE BINDS)

We are giving them a choice where both choices get us what we want
You can pick X or you can pick Y – either way your we are moving
towards my goal
Example
We could meet on Tuesday or Wednesday which works better for you?
I can have my photographer come this week or next week which do you
prefer?

### EITHER OR (DOUBLE BINDS)

Instead of when do you want the house on the market?
Also creates an assumption
We put the house on the market on a Wednesday or wait until Friday
which makes sense to you
We can price aggressively and try and get lots of offers or we can price
at the top of the market and be conservative

### EITHER OR WITH A NEGATIVE


Lesser of 2 evils
You can pick X or you can pick Y – either way your we are moving towards my goal
Example
You told me you wanted to get your home sold quickly (pace) so we either need to
offer some buyer incentives or be willing to offer seller concessions – which would
you prefer?

### EITHER OR WITH A NEGATIVE


Lesser of 2 evils
You can pick X or you can pick Y – either way your we are moving towards my goal
Example
We made offers on 7 homes and lost before you found this one (PACE) with that in
mind we can either go out and start looking again or accept the seller is not making
repairs and go to closing I know that’s not what you want to hear but which makes
more sense for you?
The roof on this house needs to be replaced and seller is going to have to disclose it
(PACE) so you can either work with us to or go through this whole thing again with
the next buyer – let me know what your seller wants to do?

### EITHER OR WITH A NEGATIVE


Lesser of 2 evils
Example
We had the house on the market for 3 months without an offer (pace) so we can
either make these few repairs and get your home sold by the end of the month or we
can say no and put the house back on the market and find a new buyer – which works
best for you?

### SINGLE BIND – DOUBLE BIND

The more you study real estate the more you will realize there is
a lot to learn – so should we meet at the office or at Starbucks to
get started?
The more you study real estate the more you will realize there is
a lot to learn – so should we start today or would or Monday?

### SINGLE BIND – DOUBLE BIND

The more homes we look at the easier it will be to see it’s a
sellers market – with that in mind would you like to start today
or on the weekend
The faster we can make the closing the happier the seller will
be – so would you like to close in 45 days or would you like to
be more aggressive and close in 21 days?
The more you hope you net in this market the more you will
have to stage the house – so should I schedule the stager for the
weekend or during the week?

### SINGLE BIND – DOUBLE BIND

The more we study the market the more we realize it is still a
stronger seller’s market with that in mind you would like to offer
full price or be more aggressive?
The longer you wait to get your house on the market the harder
it will be to get the price that you want and get moved by the
end of summer so would you like to...START NOW… or risk
waiting a little longer?

### WRITTEN COMMUNICATION

- Emails
- Text Messages
- Think about using Pacing and Leading in these communications
- Embedded commands don’t work
- “The longer we looked at houses the easier it was to see that this is
clearly a seller’s market so we have 2 choices we can accept the seller’s
response and close or we can go out and start looking at houses again
this weekend. Let me know which works better for you.
